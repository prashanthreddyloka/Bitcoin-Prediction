Using historical Bitcoin data from 2014 to 2024, I dove deep into exploring trends and predicting future price movements. Here’s a sneak peek into what I’ve done:
🔍 Key Highlights:
Cleaned and preprocessed 3,500+ data points on Bitcoin prices.
Performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights (like quarterly trends and price gaps).
Visualized patterns in price fluctuations and volume movements.
Built machine learning models using Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost for price prediction.
📈 Findings:
Developed predictive models based on key features like open-close and low-high price gaps.
Achieved promising results in predicting future price movements with ROC-AUC evaluation.
